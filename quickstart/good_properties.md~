title: Writing Good Properties

Properties should not just duplicate the logic of your code under test (this is equally true for the example based testing).

Instead properties should try to specify very simple but general invariants that should hold true. Start with very simple general properties and get more specific as
you go along.

Some common patterns (which are largely a summary of the material at [fsharpforfunandprofit](http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing-2/)) that produce good properties include :-

<br/>

<h1>The invariant pattern aka "Some things never change"</h1>


Some things are expected to remain constant, e.g a map operation should produce the same number of items that it was given, the total balance across two bank accounts should
remain constant after a transfer etc.
	
<h1>The inverse function pattern aka "There and back again"</h1>


If we have two functions that are the inverse of each other then applying the input of one to the other should result in no change.

Common examples of inverse function pairs include

* serialisation / deserialisation
* compression / decompression
* encryption / decryption
* create / delete

<h1>Analogous function pattern aka "Different paths same destination"</h1>


If you have two functions that implement the same logic, but differ in some other property (perhaps one is inefficient, insecure or implemented in a third party library) then a property can be defined that checks the outputs of the functions match given the same input. 

<h1>Idempotence aka "The more things change, the more they stay the same"</h1>

Sometimes it's important/logical that performing an operation multiple times has no effect. e.g if you trim the whitespace from a string multiple times, only the first call to trim should have any observable effect.
